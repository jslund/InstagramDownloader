# Instagram downloader

## Setup
Before running, ensure you've signed in to Instagram on Firefox. After doing so, then run GetInstagramSession.py
After running this, change the "USER" variable in main.py to be your instagram username.
This project also has a dependency on RabbitMQ. I'd recommend using the included docker-compose.
